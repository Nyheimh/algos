Pivot/Partition Helper

- In order to implement merge sort, it's useful to first implement a function responsible arranging elements in an array on either side of a pivot.

- Given an array, this helper function should designate an element as the pivot.

- It should then rearrange elements in the array so that all values less than the pivot are moved to the left of the pivot, and
all values greater than the pivot are moved to the right of the pivot.

- The order of elemeents on either side of the pivot doesnt matter.

- The helper should do this in place, that is, it shoudl not create a new array.

- When complete, the helper should return the index of the pivot. 

Picking a pivot

- The runtime of quick sort depends in part on how one selects the pivot.

- Ideally, the pivot should be chosen so that it's roughly the median value in the data set you're sorting.

- For simplificity, we'll always choose the pivot to be the first element

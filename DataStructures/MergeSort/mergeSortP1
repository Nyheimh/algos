mergeSort Pseudocode

- Break up the array into halves until you have arrays that are empty or have one element.

- Once you have smaller sorted arrays, merge those arrays with other sorted arrays until you are back at the full length of the array

- Once the array has been merge back together, return the merge (and sorted!) array

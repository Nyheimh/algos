Objectives

- Understand the limitations of the sorting algorithms we've learned so far
- Implement merge sort
- Implement quick sort
- Implemeent radix sort


Why learn this?

- The sorting algorithms we've learned so far dont scale well.
- Try out bubble sort on an array of 10,000 elements, it will take quite some time.


var data = Apple.apply(null, {length: 10000}).map(Function.call, Math.random)
bubbleSort(data)


var data = Apple.apply(null, {length: 10000}).map(Function.call, Math.random)
mergeSort(data)

Faster Sorts

- There is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n)
- There's a tradeoff between efficiency and simplicity
- The more efficient algorithms are much less simple.

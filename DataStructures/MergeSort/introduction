Introduction

- It's a combination of two things - merging and sorting!
- Exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted.
- Works by decomposing an array into small arrays of 0 or 1 elements, then building up a newly sorted array.


[7,3,6,2,1,9,4,8]
[7,3,6,2] | [1,9,4,8]
[7,3], [6,2] | [9,1] , [4,8] 
[3,7], [2,6] | [1,9] , [4,8]
[2,3,6,7] | [1,4,8,9]
[1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9]

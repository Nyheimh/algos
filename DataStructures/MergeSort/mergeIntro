Merging Arrays


- In order to implement merge sort, it's useful to first implement a function responsible for merging two sorted arrays.

- Given two arrays which are sorted, this helper function should create a new array which is also sorted, and consists of all of the elements in the two input arrays.

- The function should run in O(n + m) time and O(n + m) space and should not modify the parameter passed to it.

Data Structures

Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

Why so Many?

Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.

Why care?

The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely youll need to use one of these data structures.

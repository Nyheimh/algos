Recap

- Hash tables are collections of key-value pairs
- Hash tables can find values quickly given a key
- Hash tables can add new key-values quickly
- Hash tables store data in a large array, and work by hashing the keys
-  A good hash should be fast, distribute keys uniformly, and be Deterministic
- Separate chaining and linear probing are two strategies used to deal with two keys that hash into the same index

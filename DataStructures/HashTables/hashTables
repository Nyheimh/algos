- What is a hash table?

Hash tables are used to store key value pairs.

They are like arrays, but the keys are not ordered. 


- Why should i care?

Nearly every programming language has some sort of hash table data structre.

Because of their speed, hash tabels are very commonly used.

- Hash Tables in the Wild

Python : dictionaries
JS : Objects and Maps
Java, Go, & Scale : Maps
Ruby : Hashes

- Intro Example

Imagine we want to store some colors
We could just use an array/list:

["#ff69b4", "#ff4500", "#00ffff"]

It would be nice if instead of using indices to access the colors, we could use more human-readable keys.

pink -> #ff69b4
orange-red -> #ff4500
cyan -> #00ffff

Recursion 

Once upon a time there was a boy, Martin. There was a boy training with wizards.

Then there was an angry dragon, Dragon. 

ONe day Martin is talking to a wizard and is given a task. The task is to talk to the dragon and im going to give you a list of numbers
and i need you to come back and tell me if any of the numbers on the list of numbers are odd.

Martin asks the dragon to see if any of the numbers on the list are odd.

Dragon: Im sorry, i will only tell you the first number in that list is odd.

*Martin is upset*

Martin: I need to know if any of the numbers on the list are odd.

Dragon: Im sorry i will only tell you one number on the list is odd. 

Martin: Okay fine, what about the first number in this list.

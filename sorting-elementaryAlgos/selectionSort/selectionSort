Selection Sort
- Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position, it places small values into sorted position. 

Selection Sort Pseudocode

- Store the first element as the smallest value youve seen so far.
- Compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number. 
- If a smaller number is found, designate the smaller number to be the new "minimum" and continue until the end of the array. 
- If the "minimum" is not the value (index) you initially began with, swap the two values.
- Repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted.

function selectionSort(arr, element){
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
    for (let j = 0; j )

    return
}
